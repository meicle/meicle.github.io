          Please, call me Mei! I'm 22 years old, from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.<br>
          I have been studying systems development on my own for some time and now I plan on start working in the area, preferably with back-end content.<br>
          I'm passionate about technology, geek culture and science, mainly astronomy.
          <br><br>
          PS: You probably realized that this is not a portfolio, but you can check some of my skills and thoughts here! Feel free to contact me for professional purposes if you wish.
